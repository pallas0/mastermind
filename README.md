## Gameplay Instructions

### Overview
This project is a web-based version of the classic game Mastermind. The game is built using Flask, React, and PostgreSQL. The objective is to guess a four-digit number generated by the computer within a set limit of 10 guesses and a total time of five minutes.

### Game Rules
- At the start of the game, the computer will randomly select a pattern of four numbers. These numbers are chosen from a range of 0 to 7 and can include duplicates.
- The player has a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the correct number combination.
- After each guess, the computer provides feedback in the following form:
  - X correct number and X correct location

### Gameplay Example
- The game initializes with the number “0 1 3 5”.
- If a player guesses “2 2 4 6”, the response will be “0 correct number and 0 correct location”.
- A guess of “0 2 4 6” will elicit the response “1 correct number and 1 correct location”.
- For the guess “2 2 1 1”, the response will be “1 correct number and 0 correct location”.
- A guess of “0 1 5 6” results in “3 correct numbers and 2 correct locations”.

### Game Interface
- To start the game, click 'Generate Number + Start Game'.
- Enter each guess in the text field provided and submit it using the 'Submit Guess' button.
- The player’s guess history and feedback from the computer are displayed after each guess, along with the remaining number of attempts.
- The bottom of the page features a leaderboard showcasing the three best overall scores. Players who guess the number in fewer attempts than the lowest score on the leaderboard can add their name to this table.
